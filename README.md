# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis

This project explores the Wine Quality dataset by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic machine learning modeling to predict wine quality based on physicochemical features.

## 📈 Project Highlights
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of feature distributions (e.g., alcohol, sulphates, citric acid)
- Correlation matrix and feature importance analysis
- Logistic Regression and baseline predictive modeling
- Evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Clean_Wine_Quality_Analysis.ipynb`: Full workflow from EDA to ML
- `winequality-red.csv`: Dataset used

## 📊 Example Visualizations
*(Optional: You can add sample plots like Alcohol vs Quality here)*

## 🚀 Future Work
- Test advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
- Perform feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluate model with cross-validation
