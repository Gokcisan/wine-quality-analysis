# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis

This project explores the **Wine Quality** dataset to uncover insights into the factors affecting wine quality and builds predictive models to classify wines based on their physicochemical properties.

The analysis covers both **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning Modeling**, focusing on red and white wine datasets separately.
