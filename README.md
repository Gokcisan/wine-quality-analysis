# 🍷 Wine Quality Analysis

This project explores the Wine Quality dataset using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and basic machine learning models to predict wine quality based on physicochemical attributes.

## 📈 Project Highlights
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization of key features (e.g., alcohol content vs. quality)
- Logistic Regression modeling
- Evaluation of model performance

## 📂 Files
- `project_2.ipynb`: Full exploratory analysis and model development
- `winequality-red.csv`: Original dataset

## 📊 Example Visualization

## 🚀 Future Work
- Try more advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Better feature engineering
